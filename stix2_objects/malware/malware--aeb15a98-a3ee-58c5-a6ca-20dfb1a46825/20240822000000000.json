    "description": "Cheerscrypt is a relatively new ransomware strain that surfaced in 2022. It operates as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), meaning that the ransomware developers lease their software to affiliates who carry out the attacks. Cheerscrypt is known for targeting VMware ESXi servers, a popular virtualization platform, making it a threat to environments where virtual machines are heavily used. The ransomware encrypts files on the victim's system and demands a ransom in cryptocurrency for decryption. Cheerscrypt uses double extortion tactics, threatening to publish stolen data if the ransom is not paid, which adds additional pressure on victims.",
