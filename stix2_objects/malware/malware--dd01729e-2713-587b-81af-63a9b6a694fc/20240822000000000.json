    "description": "WastedLocker is a sophisticated ransomware strain developed by the cybercriminal group known as Evil Corp. It emerged in 2020 and is known for its highly targeted attacks on large organizations, particularly in the United States. WastedLocker encrypts files on infected systems and appends the \".wasted\" extension to them. It is particularly dangerous because it doesn't exfiltrate data; instead, it relies on the encryption of critical files to compel victims to pay substantial ransoms. Evil Corp's extensive history of cybercrime has led to significant attention from law enforcement agencies, making WastedLocker one of the more infamous ransomware variants.",
